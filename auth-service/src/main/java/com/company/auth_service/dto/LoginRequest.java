/*
 * BEGINNER-FRIENDLY WALKTHROUGH
 * File: LoginRequest.java
 * Purpose: DTO layer: defines request/response objects exchanged across API boundaries.
 *
 * Reading tip: annotations beginning with @ give instructions to Spring/JPA;
 * constructors receive dependencies; public methods expose the main operations;
 * and return statements send the final result back to the caller.
